# Toy Project -- a few python games

## Instead of playing games others make

## making our own games using AI and python

### python 3.5 and higher
### pygame pymunk needed

### color ball bouncing is based on a youtube video Alberts Enjoys

### planet collision you use arrows to control earth 
small planet gets swallowed by bigger ones

don't get shot by solar flares 

### snake game is fun
eat apples(red block) to grow

if you hit anything not smaller than your size, you will die and become an apple of your color

rival snakes will try eat apples and make it competitive for you as level increases
